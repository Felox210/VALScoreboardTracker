# VALScoreboardTracker
Extract Valorant end-game scoreboard data from screenshots and convert it into a CSV, optimized for team environments.

## How to use

- Fill config.ini file with your TEAMTAG or PLAYERNAMES (so they script can filter enemies out!)
- Put your desired screenshots in the /screenshots folder
- Run the script
- All the stats from the screenshot are now copied in your clipboard and saved in scoreboard.cvs!

The tool has been tested on 16:9 English language screenshots.

The output should look something like this: <br>

The output is sorted alphabetically by name such that all of your team with the same tag should be grouped together.

This version is expanded upon two other forks of existing tool, with the goal of updating them and making them accessible to everyone in the VAL scene.
